I tried to do the code in ShapeSolver because I'm dyslexic. Fixing this problem required no resources.

Totally forgot how case structure works:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html

Tried using an ArrayList<Orientation> but realized I forgot how to use them and switched back to Arrays. Spent a while looking at
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html
But didn't end up using the ArrayList

Somehow every orientation works except the clockwise ones?????? Scrap paper is being abused at the moment.

Supposing clockwise visualization is correct, the code in changeOrientation is correct
